> Track your tasks with your cli

![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/jsfi/cli-timetracker.svg)

This is a very early release. Changes and a real readme will follow soon.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, then link it with npm:

```
git clone git@github.com:jsfi/cli-timetracker.git
cd cli-timetracker
npm link
timetracker -p
```

The last line should return: `No tasks found.`

The alfred-workflow will currently only work if you have nvm installed (~/.nvm/nvm.sh must be available)
